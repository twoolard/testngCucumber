# testngCucumber
UI Automation framework using Selenium Cucumber and TestNG

No read me quite yet but I will give the maven command line arguments that I use to run the test. You can use whatever driver
or browser is available in the webdriver factory. I have a set up for sauce labs too but I don't have an account anymore
so I haven't tested it.

-Dselenium.browser=chrome
-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/Users/twoolard/IdeaProjects/testngCucumber/src/test/resources/drivers/chrome/chromedriver-osx.exe
